# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIM BAKING HOUSE

## Your Site: https://www.simbakinghouse.com.my/products
## Status: STUCK ON LOADING (Old code without memory cache fix)

## SOLUTION: Redeploy with Latest Code

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Login with your account
3. Find project: "simbakinghouse_web" or similar
4. Click "Deployments" tab
5. See the latest deployment from GitHub
6. If it's OLD (before today), click "Redeploy"
7. If it's TODAY but still broken, check Environment Variables

### Method 2: Force New Git Push (Alternative)
Run these commands to trigger auto-deploy:

```bash
cd /Users/kahkin/Desktop/SBH-web
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger production deployment"
git push origin main
```

This creates an empty commit that triggers Vercel to rebuild.

### Method 3: Check Environment Variables
Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
MUST HAVE THESE:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID  
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID

If missing, copy from .env.local file and Redeploy!

## WAIT TIME: 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

## VERIFY: 
Open https://www.simbakinghouse.com.my/products
Should see "Showing 74 products" instead of "Loading..."
